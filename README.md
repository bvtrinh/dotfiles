# Dotfiles

This repo is used to keep track of all the software and development setup I use.
So if in the future if forget what I used to setup a piece of software then I can refer to this repo.
It will also serve as a more streamlined way for me to setup any new dev computers I may get in the future.

My current computer is a Thinkpad T470s.

## Prerequisites for setup script

- git
- text editor

## Running setup script

```
# Sudo access
sudo true

# -a flag will install poweruser setup
./setup.sh
```
